# Code Integration and Deployment Tools
- Once the Project reaches [Phase 4 - Development Completed](./bbt_roadmap/#phase-4-development-completed), we will release our internal tool for writing and testing Code Upgrades for the BlockBits Platform, as well as deploying and validating said code.
- Can be used by any [Token Holder](./project_specs/#investor-token-holder) to write Code Upgrades and initiate Pull Requests into the BlockBits Platform, that will then be Voted for acceptance by [Token Holders](./project_specs/#investor-token-holder).
