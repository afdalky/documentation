These are a few features that could be implemented if the community really wants them.

# Direct Milestone Funding Selection
An investor can select a preferred milestone they want to fund, only being able to vote on said milestone.

# Individual Milestone Required Funding acts like Soft Cap
A project can decide to set funding soft caps to be calculated on milestone required funding.
Which leads to the project implementing only said milestones which have been funded instead of distributing funds over the whole project.
