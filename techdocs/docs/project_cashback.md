# CashBack Procedures
At this stage of development the code enforces three CashBack procedures which unlock ETH to be retrieved back by the investors from their respective Funding Vaults. Each CashBack case is hardcoded into Funding Vaults and forces the Funding Vault to unlock ETH in case it is triggered.

## Funding Failed CashBack
This mechanism is triggered if the funding of the project Failed, or if the funding period should have ended and 7 days have passed and funding processing has not been initiated. 

## Development Milestone Completion CashBack
This mechanism is triggered if the Investor votes NO to a Development Milestone Completion Proposal.

## Project Owner Missing In Action CashBack
This mechanism is triggered if the project owner misses a Development Milestone Completion Meeting.
