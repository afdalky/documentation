Welcome to the BlockBits Technical Documentation.

# Introduction
BlockBits is a decentralized open-source investing platform. Its most innovative feature is that it eliminates blind trust requirements (i.e., it is trustless), thus providing a significantly safer investing experience. This is achieved via built-in features that allow it to become fully maintained and governed by its token holders.
