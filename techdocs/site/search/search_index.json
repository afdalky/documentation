( new ApplicationEntity constructed with \"Maintenance mode\" active -\n only accepts transactions from GatewayInterface )  \n\n\n2.2 - Verify and link contract source code at etherscan.io\n\n\n2.3 - Announce a meeting using the News Contract\n\n\n2.4 - Link new Application, as a result a Proposal will be created and be available for voting.\n\n\n2.5 - Meeting: provide new contract verification link, show the changes that have been made and why they are required\n\n\n2.6 - After meeting end, a new voting cycle is started, and for the next \nProject Bylaws - Proposal Voting Duration\n ( 7 ) days Project Investors decide if the update will be implemented into the main Application Entity.\n\n\n2.7 - Based on outcome the application proceeds automatically with upgrading to the new contract ( Chapter 3 ) or just ignoring it.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Contract Migration\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Application Entity calls the gateway to accept the proposal.\n\n\nGateway Interface:\n\n\nasks current application entity to set the new contract address as an owner in all dependencies\n\n\nlocks current ( old ) application\n\n\nupdates itself to point to the new Application Entity.",
